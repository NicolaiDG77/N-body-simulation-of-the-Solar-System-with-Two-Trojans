# N-body-simulation-of-the-Solar-System-with-Two-Trojans
This project implements a numerical solution to the Newtonian N-body problem of the Solar System including two trojans. It uses a manually coded Runge–Kutta integrator with adaptive timesteps for stability and provides orbital trajectories, a rotational profile, and the system’s energy drift.
